# HMM

This repository contains the frontend component of the **Holistic Microservice Management Platform** (HMM) which is a software platform that enables teams applying the microservice architecture style to codify their knowledge so that it is accessible to other teams.  

HMM is a research prototype licensed under MIT and was developed as part of a dissertation project. We invite all interested practitioners and researchers to extend the platform as they wish or to adopt individual parts.

This project skeleton was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

## Development server

Run the backend on the same machine.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further Information

For further information please contact the author or read the dissertation (to appear in summer 2024).
